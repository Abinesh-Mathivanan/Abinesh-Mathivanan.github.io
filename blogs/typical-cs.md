# Typical CS Student

<br/> 

## Casual Greeting

Hello folks. The placement season is here, and most likely, you'll be grinding Leetcode (including myself), applying for internships, and doing a lot of other stuff to get a job in this tight market situation. Most importantly, get yourself familiar with the DSA and Fundamentals. Apart from these stuff, there are very few things we have to think about doing a CS Major other than the fancy tech jobs (they're not fancy). 

The people who chose the CS because they thought this is their thing you must keep your heads up and stick to whatever field you want to work on, try out different things, and most importantly work on something cool. Just don't do a thing just because it gets you some entry into a job, learn a thing because it's cool. 

Throughout my learning, I did Rust, Perl, TS, and a lot of things, because I thought they were cool. I like the concurrency of Rust, the style of TS on the web, and the flexibility of Perl. It just puts you ahead of the people who do a MERN crash course and call themselves full stack dev. I suggest the folks be active in X, Reddit communities for comp and related fields, there lies a lot of knowledge and opportunities. 

So, just keep doing what you're doing and lock in immediately if you haven't yet, we got this going.

## Wannabe Mark?

I'm fed up with the wannabe Mark Zuckerberg folks, who do nothing other than simply copy-pasting AI code, have zero knowledge of system design, never understand how things work, and put others down for no reason. I'm an AI person (that's my major) and, my major is overcrowded with these types of folks. I hate it. I hate it to the core. Like, how do you pick a degree just because the educators claim this thing has a better future and do absolutely nothing to improve your skillset on that, at the same time saturating the existing space? 

You might wonder why I spread hate against these kids trying to learn. I don't hate the newbies because they lack knowledge, I hate them as they lack creativity. **They lack creativity.** I'm perfectly fine with the folks trying their best to learn new things but never compromise with the inability to engineer new things and put the blame on the system. 

There's nothing wrong with getting into a new field and getting familiar with it, but not working enough is not acceptable. If you're into a major, work on it, or else just don't pick it. Why are you wasting someone's opportunity?

## Being Mid

Another common pitfall is following the tutorial. It's better to take a tutorial if you're starting up with a new tech or new concept. But sticking to that is diabolical. Like, then why you learned it? I've seen a lot of people taking up projects, "Mango leaf disease prediction using ML", "Cancer prediction using ML" and some other useless stuff. To all the people who do this, you're completely incompetent. Like, you do nothing, because you believe that you lack colors in your brain. Another similar thing is research articles. Especially, if you want to break into the research field, articles are important.

But what is a Research Article? It's not something that you slightly tweak hyperparameters and conclude that this method is 0.2% greater than the current method, nor do you just read a bunch of methods and compare them in the name of review. The pathetic thing is these people, don't even run the code they've taken from GitHub simply because they don't know how to run it. To all the people who want to break into research, focus on improving the field you like at least by 0.001%. Your idea doesn't have to be revolutionary, just it has to solve fundamental problems. Collaborate with new people, try out different things, and publish only the things you've found to be true.

## So?

Why this article exists? If you're a part of the so-called wannabe clan, I'm just letting you know what you're doing and to start working immediately. You can't just keep on fooling around, at some point, you've to take action. Now it's the time.
