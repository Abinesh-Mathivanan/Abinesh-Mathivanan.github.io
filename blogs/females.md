# Are Males Afraid of Female Colleagues?  

<br/>

The answer to this question is quite a confusing one. **"Maybe".**  

How do we define fear? Do we call a guy a coward just because he doesn't know how to communicate with a female properly? If that's the case, then sorry, you're the second dumbest person I've met this week.  

*(The dumbest person I met is that one student who constantly annoys everyone for no reason.)*

## The Setback  

Coming from a conservative country like *India*, it's almost unethical to maintain a platonic friendship with a girl without having a romantic interest. The brains are hardcoded that way. If you're talking with a girl after 9, most probably you'll sleep with her *(according to the uncle from the neighborhood).*  

This creates a void in teens, who later turn out to be the ones who either:  

- Get stuck in a toxic relationship (*just because the counterpart gives them the attention/care they never had*), or  
- Believe being single is superior and probably every woman is ... *(censored).*  

These kids will live their whole lives believing that having a casual friendship with a female is somewhat wrong in societal norms, and they'll end up passing this mindset to their kids, grandkids, and the generations to follow.  

It's a **psychological suicide attack.**

## The College  

The above is only a short part of the story. Most of us faced this scenario in school. Once we got into college, we found some freedom (*if you're lucky*) or some sneaky way to send cute texts to our crushes.  

College is the place where you're put among humans with varying personalities and expected to get along. Once all set, here comes the common ritual where each guy picks a girl/girls:  

- Some get along as couples.  
- Some have this complicated *bestie* relationship.  
- Some are just cool friends.  
- Some are fine not having a female friend.  

But we're going to ignore them. We're going to talk about those guys who try to get along and still do not get adopted by any female colleague.  

### Why?  

- Poor communication.  
- Anxiety.  
- Self-doubt.  

But why? Is she interviewing you for *94 LPA*? *(Even if she is, you shouldn't panic.)*  

These are the kids raised by parents who neither know parenting nor human social norms. Most of the time, these kids are labeled **rude, ignorant, or arrogant**.  

None of the above is true.  

These are humans who are failed communicators, who still consider *females* as alien living creatures and ask themselves:  

> *"What could I say to them?"*  

So, if you girls are reading this and feel like talking to any guy who matches the above-described personality, **initiate a conversation**. They'd be one of the funniest people you'll ever meet.

## So?  

I don’t always blame society for this. **It’s also us.**  

Yeah, society has done some damage. But we don’t have time to complain. Instead, let’s **cooperate and patch the issues**.  

- Guys and girls, collaborate and work together.  
- Respect each other.  
- Include everyone in your environment.  
- Be a bigger team.  

<br/>

**See you again.**
